The whole point of 'Open Source Software' is to encourage "stealing". If you do not honor original authors, licenses, and the "creator" of an original idea, there is no shame in saying "he had a great idea, I think I can implement it". On the plus side, we will always take into account who came up with something and if you help others succeed, we'll definitely credit you for that.
